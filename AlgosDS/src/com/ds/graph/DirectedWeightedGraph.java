 * Directed Weighted Graph Using Adjacency list 
 * 
 * Why Adjacency list  ?
 * 
 * Time Complexity of Adjacency matrix is  O(1) 
 * Space complexity of Adjacency matrix is  O(V²)
 * Adjacency matrix is suitable only for Better for dense graphs i.e., having a lot of edges
 * Iterates over all of the edges in O(V²) time
 * 
 * 
 * Time Complexity of Adjacency list is O(V)
 * Uses O(V+E) space (worst case)
 * Better for sparse graphs i.e., having less number of edges
