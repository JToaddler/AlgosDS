Pairs

Vertices

Edges

Ordered Pair

Unordered Pair

Directed Acyclic graph (DAG)


Weighted Graph
	- Edges have different weight

Unweighted Graph
	- All the edges have the same weight
	

Loop

Self Loop

Simple Graph
		- If graph contains no slef loop or no multi edges, it is called simple graph
	
		If |V| = N then max no of edges |E| <= N * (N-1)  [for directed graph]
		If |V| = N then max no of edges |E| <= N * (N-1)/2[for undirected graph - half of directed graph, because In undirected grap, nodes can connected with max of only one edge] 



Dense Graph

	Graph is called as Dense graph, when nums of edges is equal to the max number of edges.

Sparse Graph

	too few edges (almost equal to number of vertices)

Path

* Walk - A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.
	* closed walk - starts at a node and end at the same node.
* Simple Path - A walk in which no vertices (and no edges) are repeated
* Trail -  A walk in which no edges are repeated.

Cycle:

* Simple Cycle - no repeatetion other than start and end vertices.

Graph Representations
* Adjacency Matrix - representation of a graph into a two-dimensional array is Adjacency Matrix
* Adjacency List   - 
	
Connectedness of Graph
- A Undirected graph in which all nodes are connected by edges
	* Strongly connected Graph- If there is path to any vertices to any other vertices in a directed graph, it called strongly connected graph.
* Weakly connected Graph

NOTE: we can draw an undirected grap to directed graph. But we can not draw a directed graph as undirected graph.
