In relational databases, data modeling typically 
progresses by modeling your data as a series of tables, consisting of rows and columns, 
which collectively define the schema of your data. 

Schema normalization typically begins by putting your application data into the first normal form.

considering the ACA DB schema, explain the current DB design & list out no of
 
Foregin & primary keys

A fully Denormalized Table is MREF. Where REG is key to get a value ?

Need for Normalization ?


What is de Normalization ? 

Document oriented data base offers denormalized data modeling with out duplicates.


We can put department inside location. We can put location inside countries. 

We can put country inside region.

Now explain semantics of Document in Mongo (JSON)

Explain join with denormalized data to get regionla info of an employee.

This is how we are getting higher read(read operations) performance in Mongo.

=========================================================================

	
	Now explain abt key value Pairs
	
	Basic Unit in mongoDB is Document
	
	Exaplin abt Collection 
	
	Schemaless Document & Schemaless Collection	
	
	keys are no fixed to specifi type & size 
	
	collections are not fixed to specific Document
	
	So we can put anything in a single collection
	
	### NOW EXPLAIN WHAT CAN GO WRONG WHEN THERE IS NO SCHEMA ##
	## HOW TO INDEX A COLLECTION WHEN WE PUT DIFFERENT TYPE OF DOC IN SAME Cllection ##

=========================================================================

	Connection to Shell
	
	list collections 
	
	list DBs

	js script execution
	
	show help function
	
	simple query with iteration

=========================================================================
	
	SQL & NoSQL 
	
	SQL consists of CLAUSE, 
	NoSQL consists of function and operators
